@Nic @Russ @Ed 

@Graeme @Ciara @PaulHudson and i had a catch up.
We put together a Miro board with thoughts/questions on the currently active items in the Roadmap.

Lets have a discussion on monday, maybe straight after standup.

Some areas we discussed:

Historical reports 
- Dependent on Dockets and wont be properly populated until Cemex start pushing them.
- Current historical slump reports are coming from Redshift and need to be moved to be driven by dockets and stored in dynamo for frontend to query.

Site geofences
- Probably worth doing but unknown how useful they will be given accuracy of a system generated circular geofence.

Push To Customer
- Do we need to iron out any wrinkles in the live data before we start pushing data to customers? 

Live sensor charts
- What happens when a trip ends?
