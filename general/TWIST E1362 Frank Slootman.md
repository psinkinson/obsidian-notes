Hi Geraldine,
Yes, I'd love to have a catchup on this. Lots of it resonated with me.
Here were my main take-aways:
Good people are enthused by a challenge. (Increasing Urgency)
Increase velocity by narrowing scope.
Look for people to take ownership and drive things forward.
Leadership being open about mistakes and course correcting quickly and openly.
Most venture backed businesses are the walking dead. Investors are able to admit their money is gone and keep adding money.
The only thing worse than selling nothing is selling a few. 
Tech founders are able to sell the dream, if you cant get sales people to sell it then you haven't got a real product market fit.
Taking risks is essential to success. 
Founders need to understand how hard it is to be a CEO and it's not all fun and games.
"Daylight" between the organisation is deadly. i.e. Different incentives in different departments leads to conflicting interests and power struggles.
